## Simulating the effects of a section of the polymer having a different

## This is achieved by defining a second type of angle, which will then

# 2. Run a set of lammps simulations

# The lammps script loops 10 times over, with 10 randomised seeds
# NB: the seeds were input manually so there are only 10; running 11 or 
# more will result in identical results

# LAMMPS is run in 'partition' mode, where 7 simulations run at the
# same time, with a different value of bending stiffness is used in each
# simulation.

# Before running LAMMPS, need to make sure no conda environment running
# and create directories for all the outputs

# Note: Within the lammps script in.lammps_SCloop there is a
#       loop which runs 10 repeat simulations, one after the other
#       using a different seed for the random numbers.
#       Since 11 simulations run at the same time, each with different
#       Lk, then this command in total runs 70 simulations

# This LAMMPS script runs for 5 million steps.
# Scaling based on past simulations, we might expect this to take 
# around 55 minutes per simulation, and 10 hours in total

# You definitely don't want to sit and wait for this to run.
# You can instead use the command in this form so that it runs in the
# background and you can log out and come back later:

nohup mpirun -n 7 ~/lammps/src/lmp_mpi -p 7x1 -in in.lammps_SCloop &

# detail on nohup ... &

# 5. Process the data in full. This version of the processor outputs a
     large selection of data:
	- timestep
	- The rg2 of the normal section
	- The rg2 of the stiff section
	- Total Twist
	- Twist in the normal section
	- Twist in the stiff section
	- The "twist deficit", which is the twist contained in the
	  boundary between the normal and stiff sections, which
	  has to be accounted for to reconcile the previous two
	  series with the total twist
	- Total writhe
	- Writhe in the stiff section
	- Writhe in the normal section
     NB: the writhe in the sections was calculated using an
     approximation in which atoms are near-linearly interpolated
     between the endpoints of a given section.
